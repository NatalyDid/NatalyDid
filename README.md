# AmazeBowl

## How to Clone

This project uses [ProtovateTools](http://gitlab.protovate.com/UnityResources/ProtovateTools) as a submodule, so when cloning make sure you add "--recursive" flag.

> git clone --recursive git@gitlab.protovate.com:unity/amazebowl.git

After cloning and opening the project in unity, please import this [asset package](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1NdWMDvw7fQbGdQdThfTTBVSDQ). The asset will be uncompressed in 

> Assets/AmazeBowl/Content/Raw/ExternalAssets

It is mandatory that new assets downloaded from Unity AssetStore or any other heavy asset from another store, to be placed in the previous folder. This will allow us to keep the repository light and will allow us to work faster. Also please don't include any build file or temp file in your commit to be pushed as this mistake can cause the repository size to increase a lot.
